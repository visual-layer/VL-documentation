High-quality datasets are essential for training reliable and accurate machine learning models. Poor dataset quality—such as **blur**, **dark**, or **bright** images—can significantly impact performance, leading to **biased predictions, reduced model accuracy, and suboptimal decision-making**.

Identifying and addressing these quality issues ensures that datasets remain **clean, representative,** and **effective** for AI applications. Visual Layer provides **advanced tools** to **automatically** detect and manage dataset quality issues, helping users **streamline preprocessing, reduce errors, and optimize model training**.

This section covers common dataset quality issues and how to quickly detect and remove them with **One Click**:

- Detect and Remove **[Dark](./dark-imagesobjects)** images & Objects 
- Detect and Remove **[Blur](./blurry-imagesobjects)** images & Objects 
- Detect and Remove **[Bright](./bright-imagesobjects)** images & Objects

Each issue provides tools to filter by **IS** (show affected items) and **IS NOT** (exclude affected items) to help you clean your dataset effectively.
