title: Filter dataset
description: Use filters to narrow down, explore, and manage your dataset more effectively. Filters can be applied based on labels, tags, objects, issues, and more.
---

<Card title="How this Helps" icon="lightbulb"> 
  Filtering helps you instantly surface relevant slices of your dataset — whether you're tracking mislabels, inspecting object classes, or exploring edge cases like blurry or low-light frames. 
</Card>

Visual Layer provides a flexible filtering system powered by logical structures. You’ll build filters in the **Filter Menu**, define them in the **Query Modal**, and review or edit them in the **Query Panel**.

---

## Filter Menu

The **Filter Menu** is where you select filters to apply. It dynamically adapts to your dataset and the context of your view.

### Available filter types include:

- Labels  
- Object Labels  
- User Tags  
- Captions  
- Duplicates  
- Mislabels  
- Outliers  
- Quality Issues (e.g., Blurry, Bright, Dark)  
- File Type  
- Folder  

<Note>
The filters shown change depending on your current logic mode and view context.
</Note>

---

## Query Modal

Each filter opens a **Query Modal**, where you can configure:

- Condition: IS, IS NOT, CONTAINS, STARTS WITH, ENDS WITH and more  

<Note>
Conditions and input options vary by filter type.
</Note>

---

## Query Panel

The **Query Panel** shows all active filters, grouped by **AND** logic.

|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Text Search**        | CONTAINS, DOES NOT CONTAIN        |             
| **Labels**             | IS, IS NOT, IS ONE OF             |   
| **Object Labels**      | IS, IS NOT, IS ONE OF             |   
| **User Tags**          | IS, IS NOT, IS ONE OF             |   
| **Captions**           | CONTAINS, DOES NOT CONTAIN        |  
| **Duplicates**         | IS                                |   
| **Outliers**           | IS, IS NOT                        |   
| **Mislabels**          | IS, IS NOT                        |   
| **Quality Issues**     | IS, IS ONE OF                     |   
| **File Type**          | IS                                |   
| **Folder**             | IS, IS NOT, STARTS WITH, ENDS WITH|

## Advanced Features

<Card title="Cluster Navigation vs Filtering">
  Clusters are now fully decoupled from filters. You can enter a cluster to explore it without applying a filter based on that cluster.
</Card>

---

## Removing Filters

Users can delete any active filter, which will remove it from the query structure, allowing you to refine your dataset exploration further.
