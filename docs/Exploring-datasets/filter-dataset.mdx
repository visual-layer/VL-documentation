<Card title="How this Helps" icon="lightbulb"> 
  Filtering helps you instantly surface relevant slices of your dataset â€” whether you're tracking mislabels, inspecting object classes, or exploring edge cases. 
</Card>

Visual Layer provides a flexible filtering system powered by logical structures. You can build filters using the **Filter Menu**, define them in the **Query Modal**, and review or edit them in the **Query Panel**. All applied filters are combined using **AND** logic.

---

## Filter Menu

The **Filter Menu** is where you select filters to apply. It dynamically adapts to your dataset and the context of your view.

### Available filter types include:

- Labels  
- Object Labels  
- User Tags  
- Captions  
- Duplicates  
- Mislabels  
- Outliers  
- Quality Issues (e.g., Blurry, Bright, Dark)  
- File Type  
- Folder  

<Note>
The filters shown change depending on your current logic mode and view context.
</Note>

---

## Query Modal

Each filter opens a **Query Modal**, where you can configure:

- Condition: IS, IS NOT, CONTAINS, STARTS WITH, ENDS WITH and more  

<Note>
Conditions and input options vary by filter type.
</Note>

---

## Query Panel

The **Query Panel** shows all active filters, grouped by **AND** logic.

## Editing & Removing Filters

Users can delete any active filter, which will remove it from the query structure, allowing you to refine your dataset exploration further.
