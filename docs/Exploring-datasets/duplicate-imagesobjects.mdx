## What Are Duplicate Images and Objects?

Duplicate images refer to multiple copies or near-identical versions of the same visual content. These duplicates can occur within the same dataset or across different datasets and may differ in file format, resolution, or size—but share the same or nearly the same visual data.

### Common Causes of Duplicates

- **Replication**: Duplicate copies may be created intentionally (backups, versioning) or unintentionally (manual copy-paste, syncing between systems).
- **Data collection**: Duplicates are common when compiling datasets from multiple sources (e.g., scraping public images from the web or stock libraries).
- **Data augmentation**: Slight transformations applied during augmentation (e.g., small rotations, brightness tweaks) may result in visually similar but redundant images.
- **Annotation overlap**: Duplicate bounding boxes can occur when the same object is labeled more than once, usually with slight variation in position or size.

### Why It Matters

<div className="integrations-table">

| Issue | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| **Storage inefficiency** | Duplicates increase dataset size without adding value, consuming compute and storage resources. |
| **Skewed distributions** | Repeated instances of the same image can bias learning, causing overfitting or model redundancy. |
| **Noise in analysis** | Duplicate images can distort statistical metrics or validation scores. |
| **Annotation clutter** | Object-level duplication creates confusion and inconsistencies for downstream models. |

### How to Prevent and Fix Duplicates

Maintaining a clean dataset improves training efficiency and reduces risk of performance degradation. It's good practice to scan for duplicates before fine-tuning or model evaluation.

Visual Layer provides built-in tools to identify and clean up duplicate content using **visual similarity detection**. This approach looks at image features rather than just metadata or file hashes, making it effective even when duplicates vary slightly in format or compression.

## How to Detect Duplicates

Visual Layer supports multiple workflows to help detect redundancy:

Detect Duplicates:
Go to "Add Filter" → select "Duplicates" → set the desired confidence threshold (default is 1).
Export the results using "Matching the applied filter."
