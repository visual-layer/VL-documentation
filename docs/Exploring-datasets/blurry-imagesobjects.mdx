## What Are blur Images and Objects?

Blur images lack sharpness and clarity, often making it difficult to recognize objects or extract visual detail. This can significantly reduce the performance of machine learning models, lower data quality, and hinder accurate human annotation.

### Common Causes of Blurriness

- **Focus issues**: Autofocus or manual focus failures can result in out-of-focus shots.
- **Motion blur**: Movement of the subject or camera during exposure leads to streaking or distortion.
- **Camera shake**: Handheld capture or slow shutter speeds often introduce unintended blur.
- **Compression artifacts**: Over-compressed images may lose edge detail and overall clarity.

## Why It Matters

<div className="integrations-table">

| Problem | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| **Visual interpretation errors** | Annotators may struggle to label blurry data, increasing labeling noise. |
| **Model accuracy drop** | Object detection, OCR, and segmentation models perform poorly on blurred inputs. |
| **Poor user experience** | Low-quality images degrade trust and engagement in user-facing applications. |

## How to Detect and Remove Blur Images

- **Detect Blur Images:**  
  Go to **"Add Filter"** → **"Quality Issue"** → select **"Blur"** → choose **"IS"** as the logic operator → set the desired confidence threshold (default is 0.5).  
  Export the blur images using **Export** → **"Matching the applied filter."**

- **Remove Blur Images:**  
  Go to **"Add Filter"** → **"Quality Issue"** → select **"Blur"** → choose **"IS NOT"** as the logic operator → set the desired confidence threshold (default is 0.5).  
  Export the images without blur issues using **Export** → **"Matching the applied filter."**


Managing blurriness helps improve data clarity, annotation quality, and downstream model performance—especially in high-precision environments.
