  Caption Search directly matches queries to labels and captions, relying on exact or logical matches to surface content. It’s ideal for precise searches where explicit labeling is crucial.

## Caption Search Operators

Visual Layer supports several search operators to help you build flexible, accurate caption queries:

| **Operator**      | **Description**                                                                                  | **Usage Example**                                      |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **AND Operator**   | Finds results that contain both terms.                                                           | `black AND cat`,   `black and cat`, `black + cat`, `black cat`             |
| **OR Operator**    | Finds results that contain either one term or the other—or both.                                 | `black cat OR black dog`, `black cat or black dog`      |
| **NOT Operator**   | Excludes results containing the specified term.                                                  | `dog -black`                                           |
| **Exact Match**    | Matches results with the exact phrase, wrapping terms in double quotes.                          | `"yellow flower"`                                      |


{/*
## AND Operator

The `AND` operator is implied when you separate terms with a space, or you can write it explicitly.

- **Usage**:  
  Use `AND`, `and`, or `+` between terms. Example:  
  `black AND cat`  
  `black and cat`  
  `black + cat`  
  `black cat`


## OR Operator

Use the `OR` operator to find results that contain either one term or the other—or both.

- **Usage**:  
  Use `OR` or `or` between terms. Example:  
  `black cat OR black dog`  
  `black cat or black dog`

## NOT Operator

Use the `NOT` operator to exclude terms from search results.

- **Usage**:  
  Prefix a word with a minus sign `-`. Example:  
  `dog -black`

## Exact Match

Wrap terms in double quotes to return captions that match the exact phrase.

- **Usage**:  
  Use double quotation marks `" "` around a phrase. Example:  
  `"yellow flower"`
*/}

## Combining Operators

You can combine operators to write more advanced queries.

- **Example**:  
  `flower -bird OR tree AND "red leave"`

- **Result**:  
  This query includes:  
  - Any caption that includes “flower” but not “bird”  
  - Or includes “tree”  
  - And must also include the exact phrase “red leave”

<Tip>
Use quotes and parentheses to group logic and ensure the query works as expected.
