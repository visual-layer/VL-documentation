## What Are Outlier Images and Objects?

Outlier images are visuals that differ significantly from the majority of your dataset. They may appear unusual due to content, quality, or context and can affect the representativeness of your data.

These may include:

- Images from the wrong source or domain
- Objects captured in rare or unexpected ways
- Files with artifacts like blur, noise, or extreme lighting

### Common Causes of Outliers

- **Data collection errors**: Samples from unrelated categories or domains may be incorrectly included.
- **Artifacts and anomalies**: Distortions like blur, noise, or overexposure can make an image an outlier.
- **Rare instances**: Rare objects, edge-case events, or unconventional perspectives may introduce visual outliers.

## Why It Matters

<div className="integrations-table">

| Problem | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| **Reduced data quality** | Outliers introduce noise and reduce consistency across your dataset. |
| **Weaker model performance** | Models trained on unfiltered outliers may generalize poorly or become unstable in production. |
| **Hidden skew** | Outliers may distort validation results or inflate perceived class diversity. |

## How to Detect Outliers in Visual Layer

Visual Layer provides a one-click method for detecting and correcting outliers using automated issue detection.

- **Detect Outliers:**  
  Go to **"Add Filter"** → **"Outliers"** → select **"IS"** as the logic operator → set the desired confidence threshold (default is 0.5).  
  Export the results using **"Matching the applied filter."**

- **Correct Outliers:**  
  Go to **"Add Filter"** → **"Outliers"** → select **"IS NOT"** as the logic operator → set the desired confidence threshold (default is 0.5).  
  Export the results using **"Matching the applied filter."**

Managing outliers is an essential step in building reliable, balanced models.
