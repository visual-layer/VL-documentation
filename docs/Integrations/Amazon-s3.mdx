## Step 1: Configure access permissions for the S3 bucket

### AWS access control requirements

VisualLayer requires the following permissions on an S3 bucket to be able to access files in the bucket:

- s3:GetBucket
- s3:GetObject
- s3:GetObjectVersion
- s3:ListBucket

### Creating an IAM policy

The following step-by-step instructions describe how to configure access permissions for VisualLayer in your AWS Management Console so that you can use an S3 bucket to load and unload data:

1. Log into the AWS Management Console

2. From the home dashboard, search for and select **IAM**

3. From the left-hand navigation pane, select **Account settings**

4. From the left-hand navigation pane, select **Policies**

5. Select **Create Policy**

6. For **Policy editor**, select **JSON**

7. Add a policy document that will allow VisualLayer to access the S3 bucket. Copy and paste the text into the policy editor:

> ðŸš§ Make sure to replace \<bucket\> with your actual bucket name

```
{  
	"Version": "2012-10-17",  
	"Statement": [  
		{  
			"Effect": "Allow",  
			"Action": [  
				"s3:GetObject",  
				"s3:GetObjectVersion"  
			],  
			"Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::<bucket>/*"  
		},  
		{  
			"Effect": "Allow",  
			"Action": [  
				"s3:ListBucket",  
				"s3:GetBucket*"  
			],  
			"Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::<bucket>"  
		}  
	]
}
```



## Step 2: Create the IAM Role in AWS

To configure access permissions for VisualLayer in the AWS Management Console, do the following:

1. From the left-hand navigation pane in the Identity and Access Management (IAM) Dashboard, select **Roles**

2. Select **Create role**

3. Select **AWS account** as the trusted entity type

4. In the **Account ID** field, enter your own AWS account ID temporarily. Later, you modify the trust relationship and grant access to VisualLayer

5. Select the **Require external ID** option. An external ID is used to grant access to your AWS resources (such as S3 buckets) to a third party like VisualLayer. Enter a placeholder ID such as 0000

6. In a later step, you will modify the trust relationship for your IAM role and specify the external ID for your storage integration and click **Next**

7. Select the policy you created in Step 1 and click **Next**

8. Enter a name and description for the role, then select **Create role**. You have now created an IAM policy for a bucket, created an IAM role, and attached the policy to the role

9. On the role summary page, locate and record the **Role ARN** value, you will be asked to send it to us in step 4



## Step 3: Grant the IAM User Permissions to Access Bucket Objects

The following step-by-step instructions describe how to configure IAM access permissions for VisualLayer in your AWS Management Console so that you can use a S3 bucket:

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console

2. Select **IAM**

3. From the left-hand navigation pane, select **Roles**

4. Select the role you created in Step 2

5. Select the **Trust Relationships** tab

6. Select **Edit Trust Policy** and insert the following:

```
{
	"Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::027730031917:root"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
      "Condition": {}
    }
  ]
}
```

7. Select **Update Policy** to save your changes



## Step 4: Send us the Role ARN value

1. Go to the summary page of the IAM Role you created on step 2
2. Locate and record the Role ARN value, and send it to [support@visual-layer.com](mailto:support@visual-layer.com) with the title "Private S3 bucket"
3. Wait for us to review and confirm this was received and configured



## Step 5: Create a Dataset

1. [Create a new Dataset](/docs/Creating-Datasets/createdelete-datasets)
2. Select ×´Public S3 Bucket×´ as the data source
3. Insert the URL to your private AWS S3 bucket
