### Connect to the Application

Once the system is running, connect to the application using your browser:

- **HTTP** : `http://<server name>:2080`
- **HTTPS** : `https://<server name>:2443`

### Start the System

```sh
./start.sh
```

### Stop the System

```sh
./stop.sh
```

### Creating Datasets

```sh
./run_profiler.sh -n "<desired dataset name>" -p "<dataset source dir>"
```

- This process **can take several hours**, depending on data size.
- If the dataset name includes spaces, use **quotation marks**(e.g., `"My Dataset"`).
