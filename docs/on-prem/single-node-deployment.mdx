# Minimal system requirements

## System configuration

- Operating System: Ubuntu LTS 20/22/24
- X86 architecture
- RAM: 64G
- Disk space: 256Gb + 2.5 times the estimated amount of data.
- CPU: 16 cores
- Optional: GPU: Common Nvidia GPU types (Nvidia A10, A100, H100, RTX 4090, etc.)

## Dependencies

- Docker v.27 or above - follow [the official instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) and [the post-install guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/).
- jq - json data parsing library
- psql - postgres command line client
- zip/unzip

## Advised tools for troubleshooting/maintenance

- vi - or equivalent required for file editing
- object store CLIs if applicable (aws cli, mc)

## Required permissions and access

- Make sure you run the installation as a regular user (not a root user), with sudo privileges.

# Setting Up the Environment

## Log into Docker Image Repo

To authenticate with Docker, run:

```shell
docker login -u visuallayer
```

When prompted for a password, copy and paste the **Docker Hub access token** provided by your Visual Layer representative.

- If you do not have the token or it is incorrect, contact [support@visual-layer.com](mailto:support@visual-layer.com).

## Run the installer

### GPU Deployment (Full Enrichment Enabled)

```smarty Shell
HARDWARE=gpu VL_VERSION="2.33.1-rc10" bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://vl-public-bucket.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/installer/new/install_helper.sh)"
```

### CPU Deployment (No Enrichment)

```shell
HARDWARE=cpu VL_VERSION="2.33.1-rc10" bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://vl-public-bucket.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/installer/new/install_helper.sh)"
```

# Operations

## Connect to the Application

Once the system is running, connect to the application using your browser:

- **HTTP\**: `http://<server name>:2080`
- **HTTPS\**: `https://<server name>:2443`

## Start the System

```sh
./srart.sh
```

## Stop the System

```sh
./stop.sh
```

## Creating Datasets

```sh
./run_profiler.sh -n "<desired dataset name>" -p "<dataset source dir>"
```

- This process **can take several hours**, depending on data size.
- If the dataset name includes spaces, use **quotation marks**(e.g., `"My Dataset"`).

# Troubleshooting

## Resolving Common Errors

### Problem: Image Not Found

```sh
docker: Error response from daemon: pull access denied for visuallayer/onprem-installer, repository does not exist or may require 'docker login'.
```

 **Solution***Solution**: Ensure you are logged into Docker.

### Problem: Docker Daemon Not Running

```sh
docker: Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///var/run/docker.sock.
```

 **Solution***Solution**: Start the Docker daemon.

### Problem: Image Pulling Fails

```sh
manifest for visuallayer/onprem-cd:2.25.6-rc6 not found: manifest unknown
```

**Solution **: Verify the** software version**and that you are logged into Docker with the correct user.

### Problem: Platform Mismatch Warning

```sh
WARNING: The requested image's platform (linux/arm64) does not match the detected host platform (linux/amd64/v3).
```

**Solution **: This is a** warning only**—can be ignored.

### Problem: `docker compose` Not Found

```sh
./run_profiler.sh: line 159: docker compose: command not found
```

 **Solution***Solution**: Install or reinstall Docker following the official installation instructions.

### Problem: PostgreSQL Operational Error

```sh
sqlalchemy.exc.OperationalError: (psycopg.OperationalError) [Errno -3] Temporary failure in name resolution
```

 **Solution***Solution**: Ensure the system was brought up using the `docker up` command.
