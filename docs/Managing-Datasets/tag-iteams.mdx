<Card title="How This Helps" icon="tag">
    Tagging makes it easy to group, track, and manage data for training, QA, relabeling, or experimentation. Whether you're cleaning data, preparing a subset, or tracking annotation status — tags let you move faster and stay organized.
</Card>

Tags help you **quickly organize, filter, and take action** on relevant items in your dataset. They can be applied across Clusters, Images, or Objects, and used to streamline curation, quality review, or experimental workflows.

Use cases include:

- **Data Curation**: Group items for training, validation, or internal evaluation. Tags like `train`, `test`, `representative` help define clear splits.  
- **Data Cleaning**: Identify problematic items with tags like `low_quality`, `duplicate`, or `needs_review`.  
- **Workflow Management**: Add review state tags such as `approved`, `rejected`, `for-review`, or priority labels like `urgent`.  
- **Experiment Tracking**: Label data used in experiments (`exp-103`, `baseline-set`) for traceability and auditability.
