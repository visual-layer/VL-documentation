<Card title="How This Helps" icon="eye">
    Saved Views let you freeze and reuse queries across large datasets. This makes it easy to organize, revisit, or share filtered subsets without manually recreating queries each time.
</Card>

Saved Views are dynamic, named queries that live inside a Dataset. They allow you to define a set of filters, searches, or similarity conditions and revisit that exact data slice any time. The underlying data stays current—so the view always reflects the latest results that match your criteria.

Key characteristics of Saved Views:

- Views **don’t duplicate or store data**—they act as a persistent filter definition.
- Views are **dataset-specific** and visible to all collaborators.
- Each View uses a **View Descriptor**, which includes filters and/or search logic.
- Views appear in both the **Views tab** and within the **Explore tab** of a dataset.
- Views are currently **immutable**—they must be deleted and recreated to be changed.

---

## Why Use Views

Saving frequently used queries helps teams stay aligned, reduce repetition, and scale their workflows across different objectives or team members.

Use Views to:

- **Boost efficiency**— Save time by avoiding repeated filter configuration  
- **Ensure consistency**— Standardize how teams work with data subsets  
- **Create flexible workflows**— Define views for tasks like `Training Candidates`, `Outliers`, or `QC Required`
