<Card title="How This Helps" icon="users">
    Dataset sharing makes it easy to collaborate across roles and organizations. It provides a secure way to grant access to curated image and video datasets without manual handoffs or duplication.
</Card>

You can share any private dataset with individual collaborators or entire teams. This allows others to view, curate, review, or manage data—depending on the permissions you assign.
