<Update label="2025-08-10">
We're excited to announce the latest Visual Layer release, featuring enhanced 3D rendering capabilities, significant performance improvements, and critical stability fixes.

## New Features

### glTF 2.0 Format Support

Visual Layer now supports the import and rendering of 3D models using the glTF 2.0 standard. This comprehensive implementation includes:

* Support for both `.gltf` and `.glb` file formats
* Physically Based Rendering (PBR) materials for realistic lighting and surface properties
* Complete scene hierarchies with proper node relationships
* Skeletal animations for dynamic 3D content

This update enables more efficient transmission and loading of 3D content, making it easier to work with complex 3D datasets and visualizations.

## Performance Improvements

### Large Scene Rendering Optimization

We've implemented advanced culling algorithms to dramatically improve rendering performance for complex scenes:

* **Frustum culling**: Prevents rendering of geometry outside the camera's view
* **Occlusion culling**: Skips objects hidden behind other geometry
* **Significant frame rate improvements** for scenes with high object counts

These optimizations ensure smooth performance even when working with large, complex 3D datasets.

## Bug Fixes

### Texture Memory Management

Resolved a critical memory leak in the texture caching system that was causing progressive memory consumption during application runtime. The fix ensures:

* Proper deallocation of VRAM for unused textures
* Stable memory usage throughout extended sessions
* Improved application stability and performance

This fix addresses issues users experienced with memory-intensive workflows and long-running analysis sessions.

<Update label="2025-05-08" >
We are excited to present the latest release of Visual Layer. This update introduces powerful new ways to search, explore, and manage visual datasets while streamlining the UI for speed and clarity.

## New Features & Enhancements

We've overhauled the filtering experience for intuitive navigation, custom quality thresholds, and advanced query logic, making it easier to zoom in on what matters or explore freely at scale.

### Improved UI Navigation

Filter menu organization and iconography have been updated including a unified slice & dice experience and clearer visual cues for advanced logic combinations.

### Optimized Filter Logic

Visual Layer now provides logical query operators. 

We've refined the right panel to remove outdated filter controls. Now, you can build filters and review or edit. All applied filters are currently combined using AND logic. Slice and dice your dataset more precisely and seamlessly combine visual and metadata filters for high-volume review. 

Set flexible conditions per filter type, including:

* `IS`, and `IS ONE OF`
* `IS NOT`: Explicitly exclude values and easily remove irrelevant items from your analysis
* `CONTAINS` and free-text search that dynamically adapts to your dataset and the current view context

### Streamlined Insights 

All your dataset insights are now accessible in one place through the redesigned right panel. Easily navigate between statistics, enrichment models, and quality issues without visual clutter. You can also toggle between # (absolute values) and % (relative values) to view data in the format that matters most to you.

### Class Outlier Detection

Class outliers are a new issue type that help you detect subtle, high-impact inconsistencies in labeled datasets.

Unlike mislabels and general outliers, class outliers highlight images that don't fit the expected structure or semantics of a specific dataset. Class outliers often reflect edge cases, data drift, or content mismatches that can compromise model performance if left unreviewed.

You can now:

* View class outlier stats in the right panel
* Adjust detection thresholds for both general and class-level outliers WIP
* Filter by outliers or class outliers directly from the main filter menu

### Better Documentation to Support You

We've upgraded our documentation to make it faster, clearer, and easier to navigate. 

You'll notice:

* Cleaner layouts that help you focus on what matters
* Collapsible guides and tabs for scanning complex topics
* Inline tips and examples to guide you through advanced use cases
* Mobile-friendly design for quick answers on the go

## Fixed Issues

We've cleaned up some bugs and made improvements to enhance your experience, including improved search results, fixes to filters and other similar issues.
