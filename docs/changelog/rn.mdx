<Update label="2025-08-10" >
We are excited to present Visual Layer version 2.43.0. This release introduces comprehensive support for 3D model formats and enhanced rendering capabilities, bringing new dimensions to your visual data workflows.

## New Features & Enhancements

### glTF 3D Model Support

Visual Layer now supports the import and rendering of 3D models using the glTF (GL Transmission Format), enabling the use of industry-standard assets within scenes.

**File Compatibility:** Users can import both standard `.gltf` (JSON/binary) and binary `.glb` files through the asset import dialog.

**PBR Material Rendering:** The rendering pipeline has been updated to support the PBR (Physically Based Rendering) metallic-roughness workflow, ensuring that materials on imported models are displayed with high fidelity.

**Animation Support:** Embedded animations within glTF files are now recognized and can be controlled via the animation timeline. The system supports keyframe interpolation for translation, rotation, and scale (TRS) transformations.

**Scene Hierarchy Preservation:** The object hierarchy from the source glTF file is maintained upon import, preserving the model's original structure within the scene graph.

### Scene Graph API

A new programmatic interface is available for manipulating objects in the 3D scene at runtime. This allows for dynamic scenes where object properties such as position, rotation, and scale can be modified via script, providing greater interactive capabilities.

## Performance Improvements

### Optimized Texture Compression

Implemented Adaptive Scalable Texture Compression (ASTC) for textures on supported hardware. This change reduces VRAM usage and decreases initial load times, resulting in improved performance and a more responsive user experience.

### Enhanced Raycasting Precision

The raycasting system now uses a more precise algorithm for intersection tests against complex meshes. This improves the accuracy of object selection and interaction in detailed scenes.

## Fixed Issues

**Resolved rendering artifacts on specific Android devices:** Corrected a shader compilation error that caused visual glitches, such as flickering and incorrect colors, on devices utilizing Mali GPUs. This ensures consistent and correct rendering across a wider range of Android hardware.

**Corrected memory leak in asset loader:** Addressed a memory leak that occurred when repeatedly loading and unloading models. The asset loader now properly deallocates all associated resources, improving application stability during long sessions.

**Fixed incorrect alpha blending on transparent objects:** Adjusted the rendering queue and depth sorting for transparent materials. Objects now render with the correct alpha blending, resolving issues where background objects would incorrectly appear in front of transparent surfaces.

<Update label="2025-05-08" >
We are excited to present the latest release of Visual Layer. This update introduces powerful new ways to search, explore, and manage visual datasets while streamlining the UI for speed and clarity.

## New Features & Enhancements

We've overhauled the filtering experience for intuitive navigation, custom quality thresholds, and advanced query logic, making it easier to zoom in on what matters or explore freely at scale.

### Improved UI Navigation

Filter menu organization and iconography have been updated including a unified slice & dice experience and clearer visual cues for advanced logic combinations.

### Optimized Filter Logic

Visual Layer now provides logical query operators.

We've refined the right panel to remove outdated filter controls. Now, you can build filters and review or edit. All applied filters are currently combined using AND logic. Slice and dice your dataset more precisely and seamlessly combine visual and metadata filters for high-volume review.

Set flexible conditions per filter type, including:

* `IS`, and `IS ONE OF`
* `IS NOT`: Explicitly exclude values and easily remove irrelevant items from your analysis
* `CONTAINS` and free-text search that dynamically adapts to your dataset and the current view context

### Streamlined Insights

All your dataset insights are now accessible in one place through the redesigned right panel. Easily navigate between statistics, enrichment models, and quality issues without visual clutter. You can also toggle between # (absolute values) and % (relative values) to view data in the format that matters most to you.

### Class Outlier Detection

Class outliers are a new issue type that help you detect subtle, high-impact inconsistencies in labeled datasets.

Unlike mislabels and general outliers, class outliers highlight images that don't fit the expected structure or semantics of a specific dataset. Class outliers often reflect edge cases, data drift, or content mismatches that can compromise model performance if left unreviewed.

You can now:

* View class outlier stats in the right panel
* Adjust detection thresholds for both general and class-level outliers WIP
* Filter by outliers or class outliers directly from the main filter menu

### Better Documentation to Support You

We've upgraded our documentation to make it faster, clearer, and easier to navigate.

You'll notice:

* Cleaner layouts that help you focus on what matters
* Collapsible guides and tabs for scanning complex topics
* Inline tips and examples to guide you through advanced use cases
* Mobile-friendly design for quick answers on the go

## Fixed Issues

We've cleaned up some bugs and made improvements to enhance your experience, including improved search results, fixes to filters and other similar issues.
