<Update label="2025-08-11" >
We are excited to present the latest release of Visual Layer. This update introduces powerful new ways to work with 3D content and significant performance improvements for handling large datasets.

## New Features & Enhancements

### Add support for glTF 2.0 format

The rendering engine now supports the import and rendering of 3D models using the glTF 2.0 standard. This includes support for both `.gltf` and `.glb` file formats, Physically Based Rendering (PBR) materials, scene hierarchies, and skeletal animations. This update enables more efficient transmission and loading of 3D content.

### Add Support for Custom Fonts

Users can now upload and apply custom fonts to projects, enabling greater brand consistency and design flexibility. The system supports `.woff`, `.woff2`, and `.ttf` font file formats. Uploaded fonts are managed via a new API endpoint and are available for selection within the theme editor's font dropdown menu.

## Improvements

### Improve rendering performance of large scenes

Implemented frustum and occlusion culling algorithms to optimize the rendering pipeline. These algorithms prevent the GPU from processing geometry that is either outside the camera's view frustum or occluded by other objects. This results in a significant increase in frame rates for complex scenes with high object counts.

### Improve Rendering Performance of Large Datasets

The rendering engine has been updated to incorporate virtualization (windowing) for lists and tables containing large datasets. This change ensures that only visible UI elements are rendered to the DOM, which significantly reduces initial load times and improves scrolling performance for data-intensive projects.

## Fixed Issues

### Fix memory leak in texture caching

Resolved an issue where the texture caching system failed to deallocate VRAM for textures that were no longer in use. This previously caused a progressive increase in memory consumption during application runtime. The fix ensures that unused textures are correctly released, leading to stable memory usage and improved application stability.

### Correct Header Component Alignment on Mobile

Resolved a CSS alignment issue where the logo and navigation links in the header component appeared misaligned on viewports narrower than 768px. The fix corrects a Flexbox property to ensure proper vertical alignment of all header elements on mobile devices.

<Update label="2025-05-08" >
We are excited to present the latest release of Visual Layer. This update introduces powerful new ways to search, explore, and manage visual datasets while streamlining the UI for speed and clarity.

## New Features & Enhancements

We've overhauled the filtering experience for intuitive navigation, custom quality thresholds, and advanced query logic, making it easier to zoom in on what matters or explore freely at scale.

### Improved UI Navigation

Filter menu organization and iconography have been updated including a unified slice & dice experience and clearer visual cues for advanced logic combinations.

### Optimized Filter Logic

Visual Layer now provides logical query operators. 

We've refined the right panel to remove outdated filter controls. Now, you can build filters and review or edit. All applied filters are currently combined using AND logic. Slice and dice your dataset more precisely and seamlessly combine visual and metadata filters for high-volume review. 

Set flexible conditions per filter type, including:

* `IS`, and `IS ONE OF`
* `IS NOT`: Explicitly exclude values and easily remove irrelevant items from your analysis
* `CONTAINS` and free-text search that dynamically adapts to your dataset and the current view context

### Streamlined Insights 

All your dataset insights are now accessible in one place through the redesigned right panel. Easily navigate between statistics, enrichment models, and quality issues without visual clutter. You can also toggle between # (absolute values) and % (relative values) to view data in the format that matters most to you.

### Class Outlier Detection

Class outliers are a new issue type that help you detect subtle, high-impact inconsistencies in labeled datasets.

Unlike mislabels and general outliers, class outliers highlight images that don't fit the expected structure or semantics of a specific dataset. Class outliers often reflect edge cases, data drift, or content mismatches that can compromise model performance if left unreviewed.

You can now:

* View class outlier stats in the right panel
* Adjust detection thresholds for both general and class-level outliers WIP
* Filter by outliers or class outliers directly from the main filter menu

### Better Documentation to Support You

We've upgraded our documentation to make it faster, clearer, and easier to navigate. 

You'll notice:

* Cleaner layouts that help you focus on what matters
* Collapsible guides and tabs for scanning complex topics
* Inline tips and examples to guide you through advanced use cases
* Mobile-friendly design for quick answers on the go

## Fixed Issues

We've cleaned up some bugs and made improvements to enhance your experience, including improved search results, fixes to filters and other similar issues.
