<Update label="2025-08-11" >
We are excited to present the latest release of Visual Layer. This update introduces significant improvements to dataset management, enhanced visual search capabilities, and streamlined workflows for better productivity.

## New Features & Enhancements

This release focuses on expanding Visual Layer's core capabilities with new dataset management features, improved visual search, and enhanced user experience across the platform.

### Enhanced Dataset Management

We've introduced powerful new tools for managing your datasets more effectively:

* **Dataset Versioning**: Track changes and maintain multiple versions of your datasets with full history and rollback capabilities
* **Batch Operations**: Perform bulk actions on multiple datasets simultaneously, saving time on routine management tasks
* **Advanced Metadata Handling**: Enhanced support for custom metadata fields with improved validation and search capabilities

### Improved Visual Search

Visual search has been significantly enhanced with new algorithms and user interface improvements:

* **Semantic Search**: Find visually similar images using advanced AI models that understand content context
* **Multi-modal Search**: Combine text descriptions with visual queries for more precise results
* **Search Result Ranking**: Improved relevance scoring ensures the most relevant results appear first

### Streamlined Workflows

We've optimized common workflows to reduce clicks and improve efficiency:

* **Quick Actions Menu**: Access frequently used functions directly from the main interface
* **Keyboard Shortcuts**: New hotkeys for power users to navigate and perform actions faster
* **Contextual Menus**: Right-click menus provide relevant options based on your current selection

### Performance Improvements

Significant backend optimizations deliver faster response times:

* **Faster Loading**: Dataset previews and thumbnails load up to 50% faster
* **Optimized Queries**: Database query optimization reduces wait times for large datasets
* **Improved Caching**: Smart caching strategies minimize redundant data loading

## Fixed Issues

We've resolved several important issues to improve stability and user experience:

* Fixed issue where large datasets would timeout during initial loading
* Resolved visual artifacts in thumbnail generation for certain image formats
* Corrected metadata export functionality for datasets with special characters
* Fixed search filters not persisting across page navigation
* Resolved memory leaks in the image viewer for extended browsing sessions

<Update label="2025-05-08" >
We are excited to present the latest release of Visual Layer. This update introduces powerful new ways to search, explore, and manage visual datasets while streamlining the UI for speed and clarity.

## New Features & Enhancements

We've overhauled the filtering experience for intuitive navigation, custom quality thresholds, and advanced query logic, making it easier to zoom in on what matters or explore freely at scale.

### Improved UI Navigation

Filter menu organization and iconography have been updated including a unified slice & dice experience and clearer visual cues for advanced logic combinations.

### Optimized Filter Logic

Visual Layer now provides logical query operators. 

We've refined the right panel to remove outdated filter controls. Now, you can build filters and review or edit. All applied filters are currently combined using AND logic. Slice and dice your dataset more precisely and seamlessly combine visual and metadata filters for high-volume review. 

Set flexible conditions per filter type, including:

* `IS`, and `IS ONE OF`
* `IS NOT`: Explicitly exclude values and easily remove irrelevant items from your analysis
* `CONTAINS` and free-text search that dynamically adapts to your dataset and the current view context

### Streamlined Insights 

All your dataset insights are now accessible in one place through the redesigned right panel. Easily navigate between statistics, enrichment models, and quality issues without visual clutter. You can also toggle between # (absolute values) and % (relative values) to view data in the format that matters most to you.

### Class Outlier Detection

Class outliers are a new issue type that help you detect subtle, high-impact inconsistencies in labeled datasets.

Unlike mislabels and general outliers, class outliers highlight images that don't fit the expected structure or semantics of a specific dataset. Class outliers often reflect edge cases, data drift, or content mismatches that can compromise model performance if left unreviewed.

You can now:

* View class outlier stats in the right panel
* Adjust detection thresholds for both general and class-level outliers WIP
* Filter by outliers or class outliers directly from the main filter menu

### Better Documentation to Support You

We've upgraded our documentation to make it faster, clearer, and easier to navigate. 

You'll notice:

* Cleaner layouts that help you focus on what matters
* Collapsible guides and tabs for scanning complex topics
* Inline tips and examples to guide you through advanced use cases
* Mobile-friendly design for quick answers on the go

## Fixed Issues

We've cleaned up some bugs and made improvements to enhance your experience, including improved search results, fixes to filters and other similar issues.
