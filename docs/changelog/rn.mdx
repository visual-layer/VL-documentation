<Update label="2025-08-11">
We're excited to announce the latest Visual Layer release, featuring significant enhancements to our 3D rendering capabilities and performance optimizations that will transform how you work with complex visual datasets.

## New Features

### glTF 2.0 Format Support

Visual Layer now supports the industry-standard glTF 2.0 format for 3D model import and rendering. This comprehensive implementation includes:

* Support for both `.gltf` and `.glb` file formats
* Full Physically Based Rendering (PBR) materials compatibility
* Complete scene hierarchy preservation
* Skeletal animation support

This update enables more efficient transmission and loading of 3D content, making it easier to work with complex 3D datasets and models within Visual Layer.

## Performance Improvements

### Enhanced Rendering Performance for Large Scenes

We've implemented advanced culling algorithms to dramatically improve rendering performance:

* **Frustum culling**: Prevents rendering of geometry outside the camera's view
* **Occlusion culling**: Skips processing of objects hidden behind other geometry

These optimizations result in significant frame rate increases for complex scenes with high object counts, ensuring smooth navigation even in the most demanding visual datasets.

### Custom Font Support

Users can now upload and apply custom fonts to projects, enabling greater brand consistency and design flexibility:

* Support for `.woff`, `.woff2`, and `.ttf` font formats
* New API endpoint for font management
* Integration with the theme editor's font dropdown menu

### Improved Large Dataset Rendering

The rendering engine now incorporates virtualization (windowing) for lists and tables containing large datasets:

* Only visible UI elements are rendered to the DOM
* Significantly reduced initial load times
* Improved scrolling performance for data-intensive projects

## Bug Fixes

### Memory Leak Resolution

Fixed a critical memory leak in the texture caching system:

* Resolved VRAM deallocation issues for unused textures
* Eliminated progressive memory consumption during runtime
* Improved application stability with consistent memory usage

### Mobile Header Alignment

Corrected CSS alignment issues affecting mobile users:

* Fixed logo and navigation link misalignment on viewports narrower than 768px
* Improved Flexbox properties for proper vertical alignment
* Enhanced mobile user experience across all header elements

<Update label="2025-05-08" >
We are excited to present the latest release of Visual Layer. This update introduces powerful new ways to search, explore, and manage visual datasets while streamlining the UI for speed and clarity.

## New Features & Enhancements

We've overhauled the filtering experience for intuitive navigation, custom quality thresholds, and advanced query logic, making it easier to zoom in on what matters or explore freely at scale.

### Improved UI Navigation

Filter menu organization and iconography have been updated including a unified slice & dice experience and clearer visual cues for advanced logic combinations.

### Optimized Filter Logic

Visual Layer now provides logical query operators. 

We've refined the right panel to remove outdated filter controls. Now, you can build filters and review or edit. All applied filters are currently combined using AND logic. Slice and dice your dataset more precisely and seamlessly combine visual and metadata filters for high-volume review. 

Set flexible conditions per filter type, including:

* `IS`, and `IS ONE OF`
* `IS NOT`: Explicitly exclude values and easily remove irrelevant items from your analysis
* `CONTAINS` and free-text search that dynamically adapts to your dataset and the current view context

### Streamlined Insights 

All your dataset insights are now accessible in one place through the redesigned right panel. Easily navigate between statistics, enrichment models, and quality issues without visual clutter. You can also toggle between # (absolute values) and % (relative values) to view data in the format that matters most to you.

### Class Outlier Detection

Class outliers are a new issue type that help you detect subtle, high-impact inconsistencies in labeled datasets.

Unlike mislabels and general outliers, class outliers highlight images that don't fit the expected structure or semantics of a specific dataset. Class outliers often reflect edge cases, data drift, or content mismatches that can compromise model performance if left unreviewed.

You can now:

* View class outlier stats in the right panel
* Adjust detection thresholds for both general and class-level outliers WIP
* Filter by outliers or class outliers directly from the main filter menu

### Better Documentation to Support You

We've upgraded our documentation to make it faster, clearer, and easier to navigate. 

You'll notice:

* Cleaner layouts that help you focus on what matters
* Collapsible guides and tabs for scanning complex topics
* Inline tips and examples to guide you through advanced use cases
* Mobile-friendly design for quick answers on the go

## Fixed Issues

We've cleaned up some bugs and made improvements to enhance your experience, including improved search results, fixes to filters and other similar issues.
