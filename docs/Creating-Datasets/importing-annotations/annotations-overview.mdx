This guide explains how to import **pre-existing annotation files** into Visual Layer. If you already have labeled datasets, you can upload them in supported formats to integrate with your dataset seamlessly.

<Note>
Annotations must be uploaded when creating a dataset and cannot be added later. See Creating a Dataset for more details.
</Note>

For file structuring guidelines, visit[ Preparing Annotation Files.](<>)

## Supported Annotation Formats

1.**Parquet / CSV**
2.**JSON (COCO format)**

 **Important**: 

- Annotations **must be added when creating a dataset**. Currently, you cannot add them afterward.
- Your annotation file must be named **exactly** as one of the following:
  - `annotations.json`
  - `image_annotations.csv`
  - `object_annotations.csv`
  - `image_annotations.parquet`
  - `object_annotations.parquet`  
   
   <Card title="Why is this important?">
   Annotation files must follow a strict naming convention to ensure proper recognition by Visual Layer. Files that do not match these names will not be processed correctly.
   </Card>

## How to Import Annotations

1. Upload your annotation file **during dataset creation** (see [Creating a Dataset](<>)).  
   Files can be uploaded from your **local machine** and **S3 bucket**.
2. Ensure that your file follows the **required format** and has the correct name (see [Preparing Annotation Files](<>)).
