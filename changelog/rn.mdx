<Update label="2025-08-28" version="2.44.2">

## New Features & Enhancements

### Enhanced Visual Similarity and Clustering

Visual Layer now delivers improved visual similarity search and clustering capabilities through enhanced backend algorithms.

**Benefits:**
- More precise visual similarity matching
- Better dataset clustering and pattern discovery
- Improved search result quality across all visual search types

### Configurable Visual Similarity Thresholds

You can now customize visual similarity thresholds per model to optimize search precision for your specific use cases.

**Benefits:**
- Fine-tune similarity sensitivity based on your dataset characteristics
- Optimize precision vs coverage for different search scenarios
- Better control over duplicate detection accuracy

### Improved Dataset Creation Validation

Enhanced validation system provides better feedback during dataset creation and upload processes.

**Benefits:**
- More accurate validation before upload begins
- Clearer error messages and resolution guidance
- Reduced minimum folder requirements (now 1 image minimum)
- Better handling of large folder structures (1000+ images)

## Fixed Issues

- Improved error handling and display during dataset creation
- Enhanced folder validation for complex directory structures
- Better upload progress tracking and status reporting
- Resolved thumbnail generation inefficiencies for S3 buckets
- Fixed various UI inconsistencies in dataset creation workflow

<Update label="2025-05-08" >
We are excited to present the latest release of Visual Layer. This update introduces powerful new ways to search, explore, and manage visual datasets while streamlining the UI for speed and clarity.

## New Features & Enhancements

We've overhauled the filtering experience for intuitive navigation, custom quality thresholds, and advanced query logic, making it easier to zoom in on what matters or explore freely at scale.

### Improved UI Navigation

Filter menu organization and iconography have been updated including a unified slice & dice experience and clearer visual cues for advanced logic combinations.

### Optimized Filter Logic

Visual Layer now provides logical query operators. 

We've refined the right panel to remove outdated filter controls. Now, you can build filters and review or edit. All applied filters are currently combined using AND logic. Slice and dice your dataset more precisely and seamlessly combine visual and metadata filters for high-volume review. 

Set flexible conditions per filter type, including:

* `IS`, and `IS ONE OF`
* `IS NOT`: Explicitly exclude values and easily remove irrelevant items from your analysis
* `CONTAINS` and free-text search that dynamically adapts to your dataset and the current view context

### Streamlined Insights 

All your dataset insights are now accessible in one place through the redesigned right panel. Easily navigate between statistics, enrichment models, and quality issues without visual clutter. You can also toggle between # (absolute values) and % (relative values) to view data in the format that matters most to you.

### Class Outlier Detection

Class outliers are a new issue type that help you detect subtle, high-impact inconsistencies in labeled datasets.

Unlike mislabels and general outliers, class outliers highlight images that don't fit the expected structure or semantics of a specific dataset. Class outliers often reflect edge cases, data drift, or content mismatches that can compromise model performance if left unreviewed.

You can now:

* View class outlier stats in the right panel
* Adjust detection thresholds for both general and class-level outliers WIP
* Filter by outliers or class outliers directly from the main filter menu

### Better Documentation to Support You

We've upgraded our documentation to make it faster, clearer, and easier to navigate. 

You'll notice:

* Cleaner layouts that help you focus on what matters
* Collapsible guides and tabs for scanning complex topics
* Inline tips and examples to guide you through advanced use cases
* Mobile-friendly design for quick answers on the go

## Fixed Issues

We've cleaned up some bugs and made improvements to enhance your experience, including improved search results, fixes to filters and other similar issues.
