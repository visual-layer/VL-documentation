<Update label="2025-08-10" >
We are excited to present Visual Layer v3.2.0. This release introduces new features for asset import, performance improvements for raycasting, and critical bug fixes for the rendering engine and core API.

## New Features & Enhancements

### glTF 2.0 Extension Support

We've expanded our asset import capabilities with support for two key glTF 2.0 extensions that enhance material workflows and performance.

**KHR_materials_unlit Extension:** Materials can now be rendered without lighting calculations, providing improved performance for specific use cases where lighting is not required. This is particularly useful for UI elements, skyboxes, or stylized content that doesn't need realistic lighting.

**KHR_texture_transform Extension:** Direct UV transformations can now be defined within the material definition itself, simplifying asset workflows by eliminating the need for external texture coordinate modifications. This enables more flexible texture mapping and reduces preprocessing requirements.

### Performance Improvements

**Optimized Raycasting Algorithm:** We've implemented a Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH) acceleration structure that significantly improves raycasting performance in scenes with high object counts. This enhancement results in faster object picking and collision detection, providing a more responsive user experience when interacting with complex scenes.

## Bug Fixes

### Rendering Engine Fixes

**Resolved Alpha Blending Artifacts:** Fixed incorrect alpha blending artifacts that were occurring on transparent materials. The rendering queue now correctly performs depth-sorting for transparent objects, ensuring proper rendering of overlapping surfaces and eliminating visual inconsistencies.

### API Improvements

**Fixed Race Condition in Scene Graph:** Corrected a race condition that could cause the `scene.getObjectByName()` method to fail intermittently after an object was added to the scene. The scene graph's internal name map is now updated synchronously, ensuring the method reliably returns the correct object handle every time.

<Update label="2025-05-08" >
We are excited to present the latest release of Visual Layer. This update introduces powerful new ways to search, explore, and manage visual datasets while streamlining the UI for speed and clarity.

## New Features & Enhancements

We've overhauled the filtering experience for intuitive navigation, custom quality thresholds, and advanced query logic, making it easier to zoom in on what matters or explore freely at scale.

### Improved UI Navigation

Filter menu organization and iconography have been updated including a unified slice & dice experience and clearer visual cues for advanced logic combinations.

### Optimized Filter Logic

Visual Layer now provides logical query operators. 

We've refined the right panel to remove outdated filter controls. Now, you can build filters and review or edit. All applied filters are currently combined using AND logic. Slice and dice your dataset more precisely and seamlessly combine visual and metadata filters for high-volume review. 

Set flexible conditions per filter type, including:

* `IS`, and `IS ONE OF`
* `IS NOT`: Explicitly exclude values and easily remove irrelevant items from your analysis
* `CONTAINS` and free-text search that dynamically adapts to your dataset and the current view context

### Streamlined Insights 

All your dataset insights are now accessible in one place through the redesigned right panel. Easily navigate between statistics, enrichment models, and quality issues without visual clutter. You can also toggle between # (absolute values) and % (relative values) to view data in the format that matters most to you.

### Class Outlier Detection

Class outliers are a new issue type that help you detect subtle, high-impact inconsistencies in labeled datasets.

Unlike mislabels and general outliers, class outliers highlight images that don't fit the expected structure or semantics of a specific dataset. Class outliers often reflect edge cases, data drift, or content mismatches that can compromise model performance if left unreviewed.

You can now:

* View class outlier stats in the right panel
* Adjust detection thresholds for both general and class-level outliers WIP
* Filter by outliers or class outliers directly from the main filter menu

### Better Documentation to Support You

We've upgraded our documentation to make it faster, clearer, and easier to navigate. 

You'll notice:

* Cleaner layouts that help you focus on what matters
* Collapsible guides and tabs for scanning complex topics
* Inline tips and examples to guide you through advanced use cases
* Mobile-friendly design for quick answers on the go

## Fixed Issues

We've cleaned up some bugs and made improvements to enhance your experience, including improved search results, fixes to filters and other similar issues.
