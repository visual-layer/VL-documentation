description: Learn how to retrieve API credentials and generate JWT tokens for authenticated API access in Visual Layer Cloud.

<Card title="How This Helps" icon="key">
  Secure API access is essential for integrating Visual Layer with your pipelines or external tools. This guide shows how to retrieve your API credentials and use them to generate a JWT for authenticated requests.
</Card>

---

## Step 1: Get Your API Key and Secret

To obtain your API key and secret:

<Steps>

<Step title="Log in to Visual Layer">
Go to [https://app.visual-layer.com](https://app.visual-layer.com) and sign in with your user account.
</Step>

<Step title="Visit the API Credentials Page">
Navigate to [https://app.visual-layer.com/api/v1/api_credentials](https://app.visual-layer.com/api/v1/api_credentials) while logged in.
</Step>

</Steps>

> You must be authenticated in the browser for this to work. The request depends on your active browser session.

### Request

```http
GET /api/v1/api_credentials
Cookies: SESSION=<session from authenticated user browser session>
```

### Example Response

```json
{
  "api_key": "<api_key>",
  "api_secret": "<api_secret>",
  "message": "API key created. Write down the secret – it's only shown once! If you need to access your secret again, contact Visual Layer support at support@visual-layer.com."
}
```

You can also run this using `curl`:

```bash
curl -b SESSION=<session from authenticated user browser session> https://app.visual-layer.com/api/v1/api_credentials
```

## Step 2: Generate JWT Token for Authentication

Use your API key and secret to generate a JWT token, which is required for authenticated API requests.

<Card title="JWT Token Authentication">
JWTs must be included in the `Authorization` header as a `Bearer token` type on every request.  
These tokens are short-lived and should be regenerated periodically.
</Card>

### Example Python Code

> ⚠️  Please make sure you have `PyJWT` installed. If not, install it using: 
```python
python -m pip install PyJWT
```

```python
import jwt
from datetime import datetime, timezone, timedelta

def generate_jwt(api_key: str, api_secret: str):
    jwt_algorithm = "HS256"
    jwt_header = {
        'alg': jwt_algorithm,
        'typ': 'JWT',
        'kid': api_key,
    }
    
    # Convert datetime objects to Unix timestamps (seconds since epoch)
    now = datetime.now(tz=timezone.utc)
    expiration = now + timedelta(minutes=10) # You can change this to a larger number if needed
    
    payload = {
        'sub': api_key,
        'iat': int(now.timestamp()),  # Convert to Unix timestamp
        'exp': int(expiration.timestamp()),  # Convert to Unix timestamp
        'iss': 'sdk'
    }
    
    return jwt.encode(payload=payload, key=api_secret, algorithm=jwt_algorithm, headers=jwt_header)

api_token = generate_jwt(api_key, api_secret)

print("VL_Token:" + api_token)
```

<Tip>
JWT tokens expire quickly by design. For best security and performance, regenerate tokens periodically based on your security requirements.
</Tip>
