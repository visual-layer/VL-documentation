## API Request

To retrieve the status of a dataset, send a `GET` request to the following endpoint:

```http
GET /api/v1/dataset/{dataset_id}
Headers: Authorization: Bearer <jwt>
```

---

## Example Request

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <jwt>" https://app.visual-layer.com/api/v1/dataset/{dataset_id}
```

## Example Output

```json
{
    "id": "DATASET_ID",
    "source_dataset_id": null,
    "owned_by": "VL",
    "display_name": "dataset1",
    "description": "",
    "source_type": "BUCKET",
    "created_at": "2025-04-24T07:44:46.136915",
    "filename": null,
    "sample": null,
    "status": "READY",
    "fatal_error_msg": null,
    "progress": 100,
}
```

## Dataset Status Values

The `status` field in the response can have the following values:

- `NEW` - Dataset has been created but not yet started processing
- `PRE_PROCESSING` - Dataset is being prepared for processing
- `INITIALIZING` - Dataset processing is being initialized
- `UPLOADING` - Data is being uploaded to the system
- `SAVING` - Dataset data is being saved
- `INDEXING` - Dataset is being indexed for search and retrieval
- `READY` - Dataset is fully processed and ready for use
- `FATAL_ERROR` - An error occurred during processing that prevents completion
- `ENRICHING` - Dataset is being enriched with additional metadata or processing

<Tip>
Use this endpoint to track dataset readiness before continuing with enrichment, filtering, or export operations.
