  This method allows teams running Visual Layer on-prem to create datasets directly from local folders, bypassing manual upload or cloud storage.

## API Overview

To create a dataset using a local folder, issue a request to the processing endpoint with the dataset name and path.

### Endpoint Format

```http
http://[host]:2080/api/v1/process?path=[full data folder path]&name=[dataset name]
```

---

## Parameters

| Parameter | Description                                                           |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `host`    | The server address where the Visual Layer API is hosted               |
| `path`    | Full system path to the folder containing files for processing        |
| `name`    | The desired name of the dataset                                       |

---

## Example Request

Assume you want to process a dataset located at `/data/project/images` and name it `visual_analysis_01`.

```http
http://example.com:2080/api/v1/process?path=/data/project/images&name=visual_analysis_01
```

---

## Example Response

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Dataset processing started",
  "dataset_id": "12345",
  "name": "visual_analysis_01"
}
```

---

## Error Handling

In case of a failure, the API returns a descriptive error response. Common issues include:

- Invalid or non-existent `path`
- Missing `path` or `name` parameters
- Server unavailable or internal failure

### Example Error Response

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "Invalid path specified"
}
```

---

## Notes & Considerations

- Only **one dataset** can be processed at a time.
- If another dataset is already being processed, the request will be rejected.
- Make sure the server is up and the API port is accessible.
- The folder path must contain valid files for enrichment and must be readable by the system.
- Dataset names should be **unique** to prevent overwriting or collisions.

<Tip>
Contact your system admin or IT team if you encounter connection errors or permission issues during API usage.
